Work on this assignment was done throughout the span of a few days at different points since the term has started. The majority of the time spent was looking for the sources of memory leaks (haven't programmed in C since a couple terms ago) but I eventually was able to squash all of the detected leaks and errors using the given test files, gdb, and valgrind. After being dissatisfied with the performance of strcmp and the recursive memory-freeing code I wrote, I spent time optimizing by changing much of the recursive code to iterative versions and using a for loop with specific logic in place of strcmp in an effort to increase performance when analyzing the A-Z dictionary. It seemed to have paid off - it took around 30 minutes to run A-Z through valgrind (no memory leaks or errors) and less than 5 without debugging tools while producing correct output(on my machine, i7-8700, fast memory). I've written comments throughout the source code for clarifications sake. Resubmitted assignment to change char buffer for input to 256 characters instead of 64.
